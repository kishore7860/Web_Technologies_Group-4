# A Survey on DNS over HTTPS: Status, Challenges, Use Cases, and Open Issues

## Overview
This project focuses on DNS over HTTPS (DoH), a protocol that enhances privacy and security by encrypting DNS queries. It compares DoH with traditional DNS methods, evaluates its impact on internet browsing, and explores how it addresses latency and security concerns.

The paper discusses challenges such as implementation difficulties, compatibility issues, and privacy concerns, and proposes solutions to enhance DoH's adoption in consumer and enterprise networks.
